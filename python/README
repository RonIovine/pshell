This directory contains the Python implementations for the PshellServer,
PshellControl, PshellReadline modules, and the stand-alone Python
UDP/UNIX client programs pshell and pshellAggregator.

NOTE: Currently, this implementation is for python2 only, it will not work
for python3.  Python3 made a fundamental change in the default representation
of strings from ascii to unicode.  This is a fundamental change, and since
this package is a text based CLI, it was written with the assumption of ascii
strings.  To try to convert to a unicode representation of strings is a huge
undertaking, and would break backward compatibility with python2.  At this
point I have decided to only support the legacy python2.
