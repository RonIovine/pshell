NAME:

PSHELL - A Lightweight, Process-Specific, Embedded Command Line Shell

INTRODUCTION:

This package contains all the necessary code, documentation and examples for
building C/C++ applications that incorporate a Process Specific Embedded Command
Line Shell (PSHELL).  The PSHELL library provides a simple, lightweight,
framework and API to embed functions within a C/C++ application that can be
invoked either via a separate client program or directly from the within
application itself.  The prototype for the embedded functions are similar to
the 'main' in 'C' as follows:

void myFunc(int argc, char *argv[]);

These functions can be invoked in several ways depending on how the internal
PSHELL server is configured.  The following shows the various PSHELL server
types along with their associated invokation method:

TCP Server   : Uses standard 'telnet' client to invoke functions
UDP Server   : Uses included 'pshell' or control client to invoke functions
UNIX Server  : Uses included 'pshell' or control client to invoke functions
LOCAL Server : No client program needed, functions invoked directly
               from within application itself

The functions are dispatched via its registered command name (keyword), along
with 0 or more command line arguments, similar to command line shell processing.

There is also a control mechanism API and library provided by where any external
program can make calls into another program that is running a PSHELL that is
configured for a UDP or UNIX server.

GETTING STARTED:

This package consists of 6 libraries (each library has both a shared and static
version, in addition, the pshell-server libraray has a full and stub version),
one stand-alone UDP/UNIX client application (pshell), one install shell script,
three utility shell scripts, one expect script, one build script and three demo
programs.  The rest of this README will assume that this package has been unzipped
with the current directory structure preserved.  

The following lists all the items in this package along with a brief description:

  - install.sh               -- Install shell script for this package
  - defconfig                -- Default configuration file for build process
  - Makefile                 -- File for building all libraries and executables
  - libpshell-server-full.a  -- Full version of libpshell-server library (static)

  - pshellControlDemo        -- Demo application using the pshell control library features
  - traceFilterDemo          -- Demo application using the optional trace filter features

INSTALLATION:

This package can either be installed on the target host for system wide usage, or
in a local directory for limited access.  There is an installation script provided
in the top level of the unzipped package (i.e. same directory as this README file)
that will do the different installs.  This package has binaries built for an x86
target that have been tested on CentOs (RedHat derivitave) and Mint (Ubuntu derivitave)
Linux distributions.  It has also been successfully built and run on a ARM based
Raspberry Pi system running Raspbian Linux.  If using this package for a a different
target, see the following section on building from source.

To see the usage of the script 'cd' to that directory and type:

$ ./install.sh -h

Usage: install.sh [-local [<shellEnvFile>]]

  This install script will either install this package on a system
  wide basis or will setup a local install environment.  A system
  install must be done as 'root' and will copy all libraries, binaries,
  include files, conf files, and manpages to their customary system
  locations.  A local install will not copy/move any files.  It will
  only create a pshell env file (.pshellrc) that can be sourced in the
  current shell or can be added to your shell env file (i.e. .bashrc)
  that will allow use of the package features from a local directory.

  The location of the local install environment will be the directory
  where this script resides.

  where:
    local        - install locally, omit for system install
    shellEnvFile - optional name of shell environment file to modify
                   (e.g. full path to your .bashrc)

Then run the script with the desired inputs and follow any instructions (local install only).

ENVIRONMENT:

If the install script is run to setup local access, the following environment variables
are written to the .pshellrc shell environment file, source that env file to setup
your environment.

export PSHELL_INSTALL=<myLocalInstallDir>
export PSHELL_BATCH_DIR=$PSHELL_INSTALL/batch
export PSHELL_STARTUP_DIR=$PSHELL_INSTALL/startup
export PSHELL_CONFIG_DIR=$PSHELL_INSTALL/config
export PATH=$PSHELL_INSTALL/bin:$PSHELL_INSTALL/utils:$PATH
export MANPATH=$PSHELL_INSTALL/man:$MANPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PSHELL_INSTALL/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Note that if a system wide install is done, none of the 'demo' programs are installed
in any system wide 'bin' directories.  They can only be executed directly from the 'bin'
directory of the unzipped package.  If a local install is done and its environment
sourced, the environment variables setup will allow the execution of the 'demo' programs
from any location.

DOCUMENTATION:

The following manpages are available from the above configured MANPATH or
from the standard manpage locations on a system installation:

pshell(1)        - Describes the framework as well as the client program
PshellServer(3)  - Describes the API and usage of the PshellServer utility
PshellControl(3) - Describes the API and usage of the PshellControl utility
TraceFilter(3)   - Describes the API and usage of the TraceFilter utility
TraceLog(3)      - Describes the API and usage of the TraceLog utility

A complete code example of application programs that use all the
main features of the PSHELL library can be found in the files:

$PSHELL_INSTALL/demo/pshellServerDemo.c  --  Server demo for user defined commands
$PSHELL_INSTALL/demo/pshellControlDemo.c --  Sample pshell control external client
$PSHELL_INSTALL/demo/traceFilterDemo.c   --  Server demo for dynamic trace filtering

EXECUTION:

There are 3 demo programs, one to demonstrate a program that incorporates a
pshell server (pshellServerDemo), one that demonstrates a program that incorporates
the trace filter functionality (traceFilterDemo), and one that demonstrates the
control of a program that is running a pshell server from another program
(pshellControlDemo).

All three demo programs have a usage that can be displayed by typing <programName> -h.
The two demo programs pshellServerDemo and traceFilterDemo can be controlled via
an interactive client program (either pshell or telnet) that shows the full command
line functionality.  The demo program pshellControlDemo can control the other two demo
programs through a simple command line UI, but it is really meant to demonstrate the
programmitic control of an external program that is running a PshellServer via the
PshellControl API and library.  The pshellCotrolDemo program can control either the
pshellServerDemo or traceControlDemo program.

After the install.sh script has been excuted (and the local env sourced if doing
a local install), the client and associated demo programs can be run.  Run
"pshellServerDemo" and connect to it with the "pshell" client program for a
UDP/UNIX server, or telnet (or the pshell.exp telnet expect script wrapper) for
a TCP server.  Note, to use the "pshell.exp" expect script you need to have
"expect" installed on your host in /usr/bin.

(NOTE: To see the features of the dynamically configurable optional TraceFilter
mechanism, run the program "traceFilterDemo".  It can be controlled via the same
command line 'pshell' or 'telnet' client as "pshellServerDemo", so all following
usage descriptions also apply.

The usage of the "pshellServerDemo" program is as follows:

$ pshellServerDemo -h

Usage: pshellServerDemo -udp | -unix | -tcp | -local

  where:
    -udp   - Multi-session UDP server
    -unix  - Multi-session UNIX server
    -tcp   - Single session TCP server
    -local - Local command dispatching server

Execute "pshellServerDemo -udp" or "pshellServerDemo -unix" at the command line,
either in the foreground or background.  You can now interact with the 
"pshellServerDemo" program via the "pshell" client program.  Note, you can also
run the "pshellServerDemo" program with the "-tcp" option and connect with the
expect script "pshell.exp" which wraps a telnet session to make the look and
feel be similar to the UDP/UNIX "pshell" client program.  The usage of the
"pshell.exp" script is the same as the "pshell" UDP/UNIX client program shown
below with the exception of the "-t<timeout>" option and the "batch"
interactive command not being supported.  Also note that the TCP server is a
single session server with a 10 minute idle session timeout, whereas the
UDP/UNIX server is a multi-session server with no idle session timeout.
Conversly, you can also connect to the TCP server by using telnet directly
(i.e. "telnet localhost 6001") instead of the "pshell.exp" expect script telnet
wrapper.

The usage of the "pshell" and "pshell.exp" (see NOTE) command line client
programs are as follows:

Usage: pshell -h | ? | -s | [-t<timeout>] {<hostName> | <ipAddress> | unix} 
               {<serverName> | <portNum>} [-h | ? | {<command> [<rate> [clear]]} | 
               {-f <fileName> [<rate> [clear]]}]

  where:

    -h,?       - show pshell usage or command set of specified PSHELL server
    -s         - show named servers in $PSHELL_CONFIG_DIR/pshell-client.conf file
    -f         - run commands from a batch file
    -t         - change the default server response timeout
    hostName   - hostname of desired PSHELL server (UDP only)
    ipAddress  - IP address of desired PSHELL server (UDP only)
    unix       - Specifies server is a UNIX domain server
    serverName - name of desired PSHELL server (UDP or UNIX)
    portNum    - port number of desired PSHELL server (UDP only)
    timeout    - value in seconds to use for server response timeout
    command    - optional command to execute
    fileName   - optional batch file to execute
    rate       - optional rate to repeat command or batch file (in seconds)
    clear      - clear screen between commands or batch file passes

    NOTE: If no <command> is given, pshell will be started
          up in interactive mode, commands issued in command
          line mode that require arguments must be enclosed
          in double quotes, commands issued in interactive
          mode that require arguments do not require double
          quotes.

          To get help on a command in command line mode, type
          "<command> ?" or "<command> -h".  To get help in
          interactive mode type 'help' or '?' at the prompt to
          see all available commands, to get help on a single
          command, type '<command> {? | -h}'.  Use TAB completion
          to fill out partial commands and up-arrow to recall
          the last entered command.

NOTE: The "-t<timeout>" option, the "unix" specifier are only
      supported on the UDP/UNIX client/server.

Invoke the pshell client program per the above usage.  The pshellServerDemo
program uses the identifier "localhost" for the hostname, this name
name should be used for the hostname given to the pshell client.

EXAMPLES:

The following is an example of how to enter into interactive mode
with the pshellServerDemo program:

$ pshell localhost pshellServerDemo

Once this command is invoked, an interactive command line prompt is
given as follows:

pshellServerDemo[127.0.0.1]:PSHELL>

The following is an example of specifying a different server response
timeout value.  If a value is given, the default response timeout of
5 seconds will be replaced by this value (UDP/UNIX client only).

$ pshell -t20 localhost pshellServerDemo

Commands can then be entered interactivley.  The following example shows
how to display the command list in interactive mode (note that "?" also work):

pshellServerDemo[127.0.0.1]:PSHELL> help

The following shows the same command entered in command line mode:

$ pshell localhost pshellServerDemo -h

The following shows an example of executing a command with arguments:

pshellServerDemo[127.0.0.1]:PSHELL> hello 1 2 3

The following shows the same command entered in command line mode:

$ pshell localhost pshellServerDemo "hello 1 2 3"

The following shows how to execute command from a batch file in
interactive mode (UDP/UNIX client only):

pshellServerDemo[127.0.0.1]:PSHELL> batch pshellServerDemo.batch

The following shows the same command entered in command line mode:

$ pshell localhost pshellServerDemo -f pshellServerDemo.batch

The following example shows how to display the usage of a given command
in ineractive mode (note that "-h" also works)

pshellServerDemo[127.0.0.1]:PSHELL> hello ?

The following shows the same command entered in command line mode,
note that "-h" will also accomplish the same thing:

$ pshell localhost pshellServerDemo "hello ?"

The following example shows executing a command at a periodic rate
(every 1 second), this feature is available only in command line mode
(note, if no arguments are given for the command, the double quotes
are not necessary):

$ pshell localhost pshellServerDemo "hello 1 2 3" 1

The following example shows the same command as above but clearing the
screen before each command

$ pshell localhost pshellServerDemo "hello 1 2 3" 1 clear

The following example shows executing a batch file at a periodic rate
(every 1 second), this feature is available only in command line mode.

$ pshell localhost pshellServerDemo -f pshellServerDemo.batch 1

The following example shows the same command as above but clearing the
screen before each invocation of the batch file

$ pshell localhost pshellServerDemo -f pshellServerDemo.batch 1 clear

The final example shows how to list all the named PSHELL servers in the
$PSHELL_CONFIG_DIR/pshell-client.conf file, this is also only available
in command line mode:

$ pshell -s

BUILDING:

This package includes x86 binaries and libraries that were built and tested on
CentOS Linux 6.6 (RedHat base) and Linux Mint 17 (Debian/Ubuntu base).  They
should be able to run on any modern Linux x86 distribution as is.  However, if
a build is necessary for different target hardware, a Makefile along with config
files are provided.  The 'defconfig' file has the default settings for various
build-time compilation settings.  This file should not be modified, but rather
copied to '.config', which should then be modified as necessary.  The settings
in the '.config' file are then used for the build process.  If no modifications
are desired in the build settings, there is no need to copy 'defconfig' to
'.config' as during the build process, if no '.config' is found, the copy will
be done automatically by the makefile processing.

This package has been successfully re-built and run on a Raspberry Pi/ARM based
system running Raspbian Linux.  

The following is the usage of the Makefile, see the included 'defconfig' file for
all the build-time options and their descriptions:

Usage: make {all | pshell | lib | demo | install | clean} [verbose=y] [local=y [shellEnvFile=<file>]]

  where:
    all          - build all components of the pshell package
    pshell       - build the pshell UDP stand-alone client program only
    lib          - build the pshell link libraries only (shared, static and stub)
    demo         - build the pshell stand-alone demo programs only
    install      - build and install all pshell components
    clean        - clean all binaries (libs & executables)
    verbose      - print verbose messages for build process
    local        - specify local install (install target only)
    shellEnvFile - shell env file (i.e. .bashrc) to modify for local install

  NOTE: The install target option will either install this package on a
        system wide basis or will setup a local install environment.  A system
        install must be done as 'root' and will copy all libraries, binaries,
        include files, conf files, and manpages to their customary system
        locations.  A local install will not copy/move any files.  It will
        only create a pshell env file (.pshellrc) that can be sourced in the
        current shell or can be added to your shell env file (i.e. .bashrc)
        that will allow use of the package features from a local directory.

        The location of the local install environment will be the directory
        where this script resides.

SECURITY:

This package provides for remote interaction and control of a process
running the PshellServer application via an IP based client/server paradigm.
The pshell protocol used to communicate between the client and server is an
unencrypted plain text protocol.  As such, if security is an issue, it
should be treated as any other unsecure protocol, such as telnet.  The
local target's PshellServer IP address and port should only be exposed within
a local network or secure VPN, but should not be exposed for general use
over untrusted networks, such as the public Internet.  For maximum security
between the client and server, the server can be run either as a UNIX domain
server or at the target host's local loopback address (i.e. 127.0.0.1) and the
PSHELL client application can be installed to run on the same local host as
the target application.  Of course, a secure mechanism (like ssh) would then
need to be used to gain user access to that host.

PORTING:

This package was written to run on Unix/Linux type platforms and their
derivitaves.  This does not preclude this package from being ported to
any other operating system.  All that is needed is basic BSD socket and
posix thread support.  This package is written entirely in standard 
ANSI 'C'.
